#### **Can Foreigners Legally Own Property in Mexico?**

Yes, absolutely. This is the most common question we receive, and the answer is a resounding yes. However, there are specific rules for owning property within the *“Restricted Zone,”* which includes all land within 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) of an international border and 50 kilometers (about 31 miles) of any coastline. Since virtually all of Baja California Sur falls into this zone, foreigners purchase property through one of two secure, government-sanctioned methods.

1.  **The Fideicomiso (Bank Trust):** The most common method for residential property.
2.  **A Mexican Corporation:** Typically used for commercial or investment purposes.

#### **Understanding Your Ownership Options**

##### **1. The Fideicomiso (Bank Trust)**

The *fideicomiso* is a trust agreement established with a Mexican bank, where the bank acts as the trustee and you (the buyer) are the beneficiary. This is the simplest and most secure way for a foreigner to hold title to residential property.

> **Key Takeaway:** As the beneficiary, you have all the rights of ownership. You can sell, lease, mortgage, and inherit the property as you see fit. The bank simply holds the title in your name and has no claim to your property.

-   **Term:** Fideicomisos are established for 50-year terms and are renewable for subsequent 50-year periods, ensuring your ownership for generations.
-   **Beneficiaries:** You can name heirs in your trust, allowing the property to pass to them directly without going through probate.

##### **2. The Mexican Corporation**

If your primary intent is to conduct business (e.g., run a rental business with multiple properties) or if you plan to purchase a large tract of land, forming a Mexican corporation may be the right choice. This structure allows the corporation, which can be 100% foreign-owned, to purchase property directly. This route involves more reporting and accounting requirements, so it's typically recommended for serious investors.

#### **The Buying Process: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Navigating the purchase of property in BCS follows a clear and logical path.

| Step | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Make an Offer** | Once you’ve found your property, your real estate agent will draft a formal *“Offer to Purchase”* (Oferta). This document outlines the price, payment terms, and any conditions. It is typically accompanied by a good-faith deposit. |
| **2** | **Sign the Promissory Agreement**| Once the offer is accepted, a more formal *“Promissory Agreement”* (Contrato de Promesa) is drafted by a lawyer. This legally binding contract details the full terms and timeline of the sale and requires a more substantial deposit (typically 10-20%) to be held in escrow. |
| **3** | **Conduct Due Diligence** | Your legal team will perform a title search, verify there are no liens on the property, and ensure all taxes and utilities are paid. If you are using a Fideicomiso, your lawyer will work with a Mexican bank to establish the trust. |
| **4** | **The Closing (Escritura)** | The final step is signing the *“Escritura”* (deed) before a *Notario Público* (Notary Public). The Notario is a specialized, government-appointed lawyer who ensures the legality of the transaction, calculates taxes, and records the deed in the Public Registry. |
| **5** | **Receive Your Title** | Once the deed is recorded, you are the official, legal owner of the property. Congratulations! |
