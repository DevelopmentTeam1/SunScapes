**The Real Estate Market:**
The property market in La Paz offers incredible diversity and value. You can find beautifully restored colonial homes in the historic center, modern condos along the malecón, or hillside homes with panoramic bay views. Exclusive communities like Puerta Cortés offer a marina, golf course, and private residences for a taste of luxury without the Cabo crowds.

> **Choose La Paz if:** You seek a tranquil lifestyle connected to nature, a lower cost of living, world-class water activities, and a desire to immerse yourself in authentic Mexican culture.
